## Description
This is my first project using Django. It's a simple social media site inspired by Instagram. If you want to use this kind of Instagram, you have to sign up. Then, you have some options. You can follow someone if you want to see what posts that particular user is posting, you can add comment below any post and use thumb up option. All data changes dynamically. Bootstrap templates and partially ready-made html/css models were used in this application because the creation of this project is mainly focused on the backend functionalities using Django. 
This app also has unit tests that test the views, forms, models and urls.

This app was created for educational purposes.

## Post functionality
Any user can create posts. We can split a single post for two section. Main section with post image and icons - first icon is responsible for the thumbs up option, next one is a modal window with the list of users who gave thumb up, the next two icons appear only to the owner of the post and are responsible for the editing and deleting the post. Second section is the comments section. All users can leave a comment below the post and delete own comment.
